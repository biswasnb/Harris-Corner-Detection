# Harris-Corner-Detection

This project implements the **Harris Corner Detection** algorithm using OpenCV to identify corners (interest points) in a grayscale image. The corners are visualized on the image for better understanding of structural features.

## What is Harris Corner Detection?

The Harris Corner Detector identifies points in an image where the surrounding region shows significant changes in intensity in multiple directions. These points often correspond to key features like corners and intersections.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Reads an image and converts it to grayscale.
- Applies Harris corner detection.
- Highlights detected corners in red.
- Displays both the original and processed images side by side.
