# Harris-Corner-Detection

This project implements the **Harris Corner Detection** algorithm using OpenCV to identify corners (interest points) in a grayscale image. The corners are visualized on the image for better understanding of structural features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Reads an image and converts it to grayscale.
- Applies Harris corner detection.
- Highlights detected corners in red.
- Displays both the original and processed images side by side.
